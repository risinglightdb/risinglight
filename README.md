# RisingLight

[![CI](https://github.com/singularity-data/risinglight/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/singularity-data/risinglight/actions)

RisingLight is an OLAP database system for educational purpose. It is still in rapid development.

## Quick Start

Currently, RisingLight only supports Linux or macOS. If you are familiar with the Rust programming language, you can start an interactive shell with:

```
cargo run
# or start in release mode
cargo run --release
```

Otherwise, see [Install, Run, and Develop RisingLight](docs/00-develop.md) for more information. We provide step-by-step guide on how to compile and run RisingLight from scratch.

## Documentation

All documentation can be found in [docs](docs/) folder. At the same time, dev docs are also available in `make docs` (latest) or crates.io (stable).

<!-- TODO: upload to crates.io and update docs URL -->

## Roadmap

We plan to release a stable version of RisingLight in the near future, as well as a tutorial in Chinese on how to build an OLAP database from scratch. See the pinned Roadmap issue for more information.

<!-- TODO: create a Roadmap issue -->
