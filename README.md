# RisingLight

[![CI](https://github.com/singularity-data/risinglight/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/singularity-data/risinglight/actions)

RisingLight is an OLAP database system for educational purpose.

### Quick Start

```
make deps

```

### Progress

The system design refers to [RisingWave C++ version](https://github.com/singularity-data/risingwave/tree/master/cpp). We will also "borrow" some code from Rust version.  

Our preliminary goal is to support three basic SQL statements `create table t1 (v1 int not null, v2 int not null)`, `insert into t1 (1,2), (3, 4), (5,6)` and `select v1, v2, v1 + v2 from t1`.  

- [x] Implement a basic catalog system (Mingji).
- [x] Implement a parser tree transformer, we need to transfer AST into our own statement definition [Reference](https://github.com/singularity-data/risingwave/tree/master/cpp/src/parser/statement). (Runji)
- [x] Implement a very basic binder.
- [ ] Implement planner, we will distinguish logical plan and physical plan, which are necessary for optimizer in the future. (Altough the content of two types of plan might be the same).
- [ ] Implement in-memory storage
- [ ] Implement basic executors.
